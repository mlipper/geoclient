== Development

This section documents building Geoclient from source, the project's core architecture and several development use cases.

'''

=== Core design

The `geoclient-core` subproject defines the API and implementation of the Java classes responsible for transforming the output of a Geosupport function call into runtime objects contains a structured representation of the data.
Geosupport responses are either one or two large character buffers containing position-delimited values defined by the Geosupport API.
In Java land, courtesy of the `geoclient-jni` subproject, these buffers are contained in `java.nio.ByteBuffer` instances.

It is the responsibility of the classes in the `gov.nyc.doitt.gis.geoclient.function` package to pluck out each attribute and place it in a `java.util.Map<String, Object>`.
The `geoclient.xml` configuration file provides the name of the attribute used as the `Map` key and the start and end positions of the attribute's location in the `ByteBuffer`.

This class diagram shows the composition of the core classes responsibile for this process:

=== Platforms

Linux x86_64:: Runs on recent kernel versions with `libc6`. Lots of successful production experience with `debian` and `RHEL`-based distros.
Windows x86_64:: Can run on Windows 10 or 11. Not recommended for production use.

=== Building from source

****
Building Geoclient from source is tricky because of the many combinations of platforms, runtimes, tools, and pre-existing Geosupport binary artifacts.

At this time, the New York City Department of City Planning only distributes binaries for Linux and Windows. The macOS platform is *not* supported.

If you have a choice, prefer building on Linux as more of the standard C/JNI conventions work as expected. It is possible to build and run Geoclient/Geosupport on Windows, but we highly recommend Linux for the best performance.

Finally, always use 64-bit versions of all software. 32-bit versions are *not* supported.
****

==== Requirements

* 64-bit Geosupport
* 64-bit JDK 17+ ("Full" JDK required. JRE by itself will *not* build)
* Gradle 8.7+
* 64-bit Linux or Windows
* 64-bit native `C` and `C&#43;&#43;` compilers: `gcc` and `g&#43;&#43;`

==== Gradle Build

.Gradle build from bash
[source,sh,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
git clone {geoclient-repo}
cd geoclient
./gradlew build

==== geoclient-service

The `geoclient-service` project uses Spring Boot for dependency-injection
and to minimize the need boiler-plate code and configuration.
The `geoclient-service/src/main/resources/application.yaml` file is used
to configure the runtime environment and properties for different profiles.

For complete documentation of Spring Boot and the functionality configured in `application.yaml`, see:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.external-config
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.profiles

The default profile is specified first and active unless overridden.
Optional profiles are demarcated by lines beginning with "--"
and can add new functionality or override default properties.

NOTE: When using gradle to run the `bootRun` task provided by the `spring-boot`
plugin, the following syntax is used to specify active profiles and/or
override specific application properties managed by `spring-boot`.

For example,

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=bootRun,accesslog --server.tomcat.basedir=/var/log'
----

WARNING: This profile should NOT be used in production environments because it
specifies a permissive configuration of Spring Actuator.

NOTE: Although no longer required, the Java system property `gc.jni.version`
can be provided on any command line. This sets the name of the subfolder in
`java.tmpdir` where the native libraries in the `geoclient-jni` jar will be unpacked.

For example, with the Gradle `bootRun` task:

[source, bash]
----
  ./gradlew -Dgc.jni.version=geoclient-jni-2 ...
----

NOTE: The following logging levels can be added to any profile,
including the default, for logging specific functionality.

geoclient-jni: "DEBUG":: Native C runtime and JNI configuration at startup.
gov.nyc.doitt.gis.geoclient.config.xml: "DEBUG":: XML deserialization into WorkArea fields at startup.
gov.nyc.doitt.gis.geoclient.function.GeosupportFunction: "TRACE":: Raw character buffer values from geosupport requests/repsonses.
gov.nyc.doitt.gis.geoclient.service.invoker.GeosupportServiceImpl: "DEBUG":: Request/response HashMaps before/after geosupport call.

NOTE: The `accesslog` profile enables HTTP request logging from the embedded Tomcat Servlet container. By default the log is written to: `/workspaces/tomcat/logs/access.log`

[source, properties]
----
<server.tomcat.basedir> = /workspaces/tomcat
<server.tomcat.accesslog.directory> = logs
<server.tomcat.suffix> = .log
----

The `<basedir>` property is relative to the system
temp directory if not given as an absolute path.
The `<accesslog.directory>` is always relative to
`<basedir>`.

Properties can be overridden at invocation time:

[source, bash]
----
--server.tomcat.basedir=...
--server.tomcat...etc.
----

If experiencing issues, insure the `tomcat-access`
logging group is defined above and set to `TRACE`
below. Also, try creating the target directory
if it does not exist before starting the app.

=== Docker

This section explains two common ways to build and run `geoclient` using Docker. It is based on `Dockerfile` files in the `<project root>/images` directory:

* <<the-build-image,build.Dockerfile>> which installs Geosupport, builds this project from source, and then runs `geoclient-service`.
* <<the-run-image,run.Dockerfile>> which runs `geoclient-service` using an externally specified `geoclient-service` Jar file in the container where a configured Geosupport installation has been mounted on the file system using a Docker `Volume`.

==== Assumptions

* All examples assume you have a local clone of the `geoclient` GitHub https://github.com/mlipper/geoclient.git[repository] and are running commands from the root project directory.
+
See <<building-a-docker-image-from-source,Building Docker Images>> below for details.

* Containers built from these images expect that Geosupport (`GEOSUPPORT_BASE`) is installed in `/opt/geosupport` at runtime.
* These examples start containers in the foregroung with the `-t` switch. To run `geoclient` in the background, use the `-d` switch instead.

==== Requirements

* The `geoclient` REST service (`geoclient-service`) *requires* a Geosupport installation to work.
* The examples here require the Geosupport distribution packaged by the https://github.com/mlipper/geosupport-docker[geosupport-docker] project:
 ** Compiling the `geoclient-jni` C code requires patched header files.
 ** The `Dockerfile` examples rely on the additional management and installation features that `geosupport-docker` provides.
 ** See <<about-geosupport-docker,below>> for more details about `geosupport-docker`.

_NOTE: geoclient can use the official Linux distribution of Geosupport available from New York City's https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/index.page[Department of City Planning]. However, additional installation and configuration steps are required._

==== Building a Docker image from source

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to build and run Geoclient in a Docker container as might be done as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline.

NOTE: See the `<project root>/ci/Dockerfile` file which this project uses for CI. It similar `build.Dockerfile` but adds some extra commands to aggregate test and coverage reports.

Start by cloning `geoclient` from GitHub and changing to the project's *root* directory.

[source,sh,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
git clone {geoclient-repo}

# Change to the root project directory.
cd ./geoclient
----

==== The `build` image

This image installs Geosupport, builds the project from source using https://gradle.org/[Gradle], and runs geoclient.

A complete Geosupport installation is approximately 2.3 GB in size and adding it directly to the image results in both a _very_ large image and container. In general, prefer adding Geosupport via a <<creating-a-named-geosupport-volume,named volume>>.

. Build the image from the root of the project.
+
[,sh]
----
 docker build -t geoclient:latest-build -f images/build.Dockerfile .
----

. Create and run a temporary container in the background, mapping the container port `8080` to your host port `8080`.
+
[,sh]
----
 docker run --rm -t -p 8080:8080 geoclient:latest-build
----

. <<testing-the-container,Test the container>>.

==== The `run` image

Runs geoclient using the exploded contents of the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[spring-boot]-packaged jar built from the `geoclient-service` subproject.

. Build the `run` image from the root of the project.
+
[,sh]
----
 docker build -t geoclient:latest-run -f images/run.Dockerfile .
----
+
This assumes you are using the `geoclient.jar` jar artifact produced by the `geoclient/geoclient-service` subproject's Gradle `build` task. If the the default geoclient-service bootJar artifact `<root project>/geoclient-service/libs/geoclient.jar` is somewhere else, add a Docker build argument with the path to jar file:
+
[,sh]
----
 docker build --build-arg JARFILE=/path/to/geoclient-service.jar -t geoclient:latest-run -f images/run.Dockerfile .
----

. Follow the steps <<creating-a-named-geosupport-volume,below>> to create a local volume named `geosupport-latest`, pre-populated with the uncompressed Geosupport distribution.
. Run a temporary container, mounting the local `geosupport-latest` volume into the container at `/opt/geosupport`.
+
[,sh]
----
 docker run --rm -t --mount source=geosupport-latest,target=/opt/geosupport -p 8080:8080 geoclient:latest-run
----

. <<testing-the-container,Test the container>>.

==== Creating a named Geosupport volume

Create a local, named volume containing a Geosupport installation, using the https://github.com/mlipper/geosupport-docker[geosupport-docker] project. Use the default `GEOSUPPORT_BASE` path of `/opt/geosupport`.

[,sh]
----
   docker volume create geosupport-latest
   docker run --rm --mount source=geosupport-latest,target=/opt/geosupport mlipper/geosupport-docker:latest /bin/true
----

_See the https://github.com/mlipper/geosupport-docker/blob/main/README.md[`README`] for <<about-geosupport-docker,geosupport-docker>> for a more detailed example._

==== Docker Compose

This section assumes you've followed the instructions in <<the-run-image,The Run Image>> and <<creating-a-named-geosupport-volume,Creating a Named Geosupport Volume>> above. The following objects should be available from your local Docker registry/installation:

* The `geoclient:latest-run` image.
* The `geosupport-latest` volume.

Note that the `GEOCLIENT_IMAGE` and `GEOSUPPORT_VOLUME` environment variables are defaulted to `geoclient:latest-run` and `geosupport-latest`, respectively by the `images/.env` file.

To start the service, run the following from the geoclient project root directory:

[,sh]
----
docker compose -f images/compose.yaml up
----

To shut down the service, run:

[,sh]
----
docker compose -f images/compose.yaml down
----

==== Testing the container

This section assumes you are running Geoclient on your workstation, mapped to local port `8080`; e.g., by running a container built using `build.Dockerfile`, `run.Dockerfile`, or `compose.yaml` described above.

Geocode a NYC intersection. E.g., "east 53 street and 3rd avenue".

* Use `curl` from the command line
+
[,sh]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8080/geoclient/v2/search?input=east%2053%20street%20and%203rd%20avenue'
----

* Or use a browser to open http://localhost:8080/geoclient/v2/search?input=east%2053%20street%20and%203rd%20avenue[the same URL].

==== About geosupport-docker

The https://github.com/mlipper/geosupport-docker[geosupport-docker] provides an opinionated, re-packaged version of the official Linux distribution of Geosupport available from New York City's https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/index.page[Department of City Planning]. This project's Docker images depend upon ``geosupport-docker``'s CLI scripts and patched `C` header files for installation, system configuration and native compilation tasks.

Although the `geoclient` runtime only requires that Geosupport's shared libraries are accessible to the `JVM` (via `ldconfig`, `java.library.path`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.) and that the `GEOFILES` environment variable is set to the absolute path (_with an appended '/' character_) of Geosupport's data files, use of `geosupport-docker`, greatly simplifies the effort of installing and managing Geosupport.

=== Kubernetes

This section provides a very basic example of deploying Geoclient to {kubernetes}[Kubernetes] using {minikube}/docs/start/[Minikube]. The configuration files are part of the project's source, located in the `<project root>/manifests` directory.

This example uses existing Geoclient and Geosupport Docker images that are publicly available on Docker Hub rather than from a local Docker container registry (e.g., Docker Desktop). Although Minikube supports the use of local registries, this requires extra configuration which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

These are the public Docker Hub registries configured in the `kustomization.yaml` file:

* {geoclient-registry}[`mlipper/geoclient`] 
* {geosupport-docker-registry}[`mlipper/geosupport-docker`] 

For information on configuring Minikube to use a local registry, see Minikube's documentation on {minikube}/docs/handbook/registry/[configuring registries] and {minikube}/docs/handbook/pushing/[pushing images].

==== Asumptions

This section assumes:

* Working installation of {minikube}/docs/start/[Minikube].
* Working installation of {kubectl}[`kubectl`].
+
This should be a recent version of `kubectl` that has built-in support for {kustomize}/[`kustomize`].
+
NOTE: Minikube includes `kubectl` and it is run using `+minikube kubectl+`. This section assumes you've either got `kubectl` installed separately or are using Minikube's built-in but have aliased `minikube kubectl` to `kubectl`.
* Minikube is using the default, out-of-the-box support for `PersistentVolume` of type {minikube}/docs/handbook/persistent_volumes/[`hostPath`].
* Minikube can connect to the Internet to download images from the public `geoclient` and `geosupport-docker` registries mentioned above.

==== Start Minikube

[,sh]
----
minikube start
----

==== Configure `kubectl`

Configure `kubectl` to use Minikube. The following assumes you're using the default context name `minikube`:

[,sh]
----
kubectl config use-context minikube
----

==== Use `kubectl` and `kustomize` to deploy to Minikube

This tutorial uses https://kustomize.io/[`kustomize`] to provide a simple templating mechanism which simplifies configuring Geoclient and Geosupport versions and environment variables in a single `kustomization.yaml`. To run `kustomize` commands with `kubectl`, add the `-k` switch.

From your shell, `cd` into the `<project root>/manifests` directory.

If this is the first time you're deploying Geoclient to this Minikube cluster, some one-time setup is required:

[,sh]
----
# Create the  gis-apps Namespace
kubectl create -f namespace.yaml

# Create the PersistentVolumeClaim used to mount a Geosupport installation into the Pods' filesystem.
kubectl apply -f pvc-geosupport.yaml
----

Now use `kustomize` to template the manifest files (`deployment.yaml`, `hpa.yaml`, `service.yaml`) and apply them with `kubectl`:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -k .
----

This will create the `geoclient-v2` Service, Deployment, andf HorizontalPodAutoscaling objects. This take a minute or two (depending on your hardware, network connection, Minikube configuration, etc.). The next step requires that all pods be up and running. To see the progress of pod initializations, add the watch switch, `-w`, to the `get pods` command:

[,sh]
----
kubectl get pods -w

NAME                            READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
geoclient-v2-75899fdc94-drtnn   0/1     Init:0/1   0          16s
geoclient-v2-75899fdc94-p2v5l   0/1     Running    0          31s
----

In the example above, you can see that one pod is up and running but the other is still initializing.

[,sh]
----
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
geoclient-v2-75899fdc94-drtnn   1/1     Running   0             58m
geoclient-v2-75899fdc94-p2v5l   1/1     Running   1 (58m ago)   59m
----

Once both are running, you need to make the `geoclient-v2` service visible to your host machine. To do this, use the `kubectl port-forward` command. The syntax for this command is `kubectl port-forward service/<service name> <host port>:<service port>`.

Run:

[,sh]
----
kubectl port-forward service/geoclient-v2 8081:8080
----

Note that the `+kubectl port-forward ...+` command above will block your terminal (unless you run it in the background by appending a `&` to the end of the line).

==== Using different versions of Geoclient or Geosupport

Both `geoclient` and `geosupport-docker` are actively developed projects and new versions are being released regularly. `kustomize` is very useful for "externalizing" the configuration of image tags or environment variables.

Snippet from the `kustomization.yaml` file:

[,yaml]
----
configMapGenerator:
- name: geosupport-env
  literals:
    - GEOFILES=/opt/geosupport/current/fls/
    - GEOSUPPORT_FULLVERSION=25a1_25.11       # A #
    - GEOSUPPORT_HOME=/opt/geosupport/current

images:
- name: docker.io/mlipper/geosupport-docker
  newTag: 2.0.26                              # B #
- name: docker.io/mlipper/geoclient
  newTag: 2.0.1                               # C #
----

In the configuration above, `A` will almost always need to change when `B` is changed because almost every new `geosupport-docker` release implies a new version of Geosupport.

`C` is where the version of the `geoclient` image is configured. This can change independently of the Geosupport version.

==== Bask in the glory of your handiwork

Now, geoclient-v2 is running locally, listening on port (`<host port>`) `8081`. By default, geoclient-v2's base endpoint URL is `+http://localhost:8081/geoclient/v2+`. 

However, to do anything useful you need to call one of Geoclient's service <<endpoints,endpoints>>, adding any relevant arguments to the query string.

Try, for example, `/version` endpoint by opening http://localhost:8081/geoclient/v2/version[http://localhost:8081/geoclient/v2/version] in your browser.

Try calling the same endpoint from the command line with `curl`:

[,sh]
----
curl -s --get http://localhost:8081/geoclient/v2/version
----

NOTE: If you're making Geoclient requests in a browser, the service is exposed with `http` and not `https`. Many browsers automatically convert `http` to `https` if you're cutting and pasting or double-clicking a link. Make sure the browser is using the correct scheme if you are having problems.
