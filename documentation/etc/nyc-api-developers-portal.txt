The Geoclient API is a RESTful web service for geocoding locations in
New York City.

Geoclient uses the Department of City Planningâ€™s Geosupport system as its
primary geocoder and exposes the most commonly used Geosupport functions
through simple and easy to use REST endpoints.

In addition to Geosupport geocoding, Geoclient provides single-field
searching, NYC-specific parsing of location text, stand-alone Java
libraries and more.
