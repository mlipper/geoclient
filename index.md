#### *Upcoming service changes*

:warning: There are planned service changes to Geoclient endpoints hosted by NYC.

> * All hosted `/geoclient/v1` endpoints *will be __shut down__ on October 1st, 2025*
> * If your app uses `geoclient v1`, you *must* switch to `geoclient v2` before that date **to avoid service disruptions**
> * For complete details, see [Upcoming Changes to Hosted Geoclient Services](./docs/current/user-guide/changes.html)
